## Simple Kanban

This is a simple Kanban board application built using Next.js, React, react-beautiful-dnd for drag-and-drop functionality, and IndexedDB via Dexie.js for offline storage. This app allows users to create, move, and delete tasks across different columns in a Kanban-style board, with offline access supported.
